## About

This app was created as part of a Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree project. The HTML and CSS for the static game board was provided, and I added the JavaScript functionality.

## Installation

No installation is required. Play directly in your browser by following this link: https://lysha7.github.io/fend-project-memory-game/. Or download the files and open index.html in a browser to play locally.

## Instructions

The game is played like a regular memory game. Click on two cards to turn them over. If they match, they remain face up. If not, they will turn back over. The point of the game is to find all of the matches in the least number of moves.
